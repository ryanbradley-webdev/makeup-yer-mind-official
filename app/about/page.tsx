                    <p>
                        I&apos;m a professional makeup artist, SFX makeup artist, actress, voice over actress â€¦ my goodness the list goes on!
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        For years I struggled with my own self-image. Working in an industry that places a lot of weight on the way you look can take a toll on the mind if one lets themselves spiral into the &quot;I&apos;m not enough&quot; mentality. Which is why I began searching out ways to learn to love myself as I am, not what I think the world wants me to be.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I&apos;ve always had a passion for makeup and beauty as a form of self-expression and for the longest time my friends and family, heck even strangers begged me to create some sort of place for them to learn from the knowledge I&apos;ve acquired over the years!
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In October of 2021 I enrolled as an Artist with Seint Beauty and life has never been the same since. That&apos;s when Makeup Yer Mind was born!

                        Since then it&apos;s become not only a place for me to share my favorite beauty tips and products with you all but also a journey of self-discovery.

                    <p>
                        I firmly believe that unless you truly believe you&apos;re beautiful, you&apos;ll never see it on the outside. So my goal is to help you through my own endeavors. This place is as much a form of respite for me as I hope it becomes for you.

                    <p>
                        I am so incredibly glad you&apos;re here.
